# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-12

This log captures the detailed changes and context for the recent work on Ponds & Mapping, Acreage tools, and the unified Notes panel (typing, dictation, audio memos, transcription).

## Overview

- Fixed acreage polygon save/load mapping.
- Stabilized and enhanced Ponds & Mapping (aerial default, north arrow, geolocation, search, zoom-based simplification, header overlap fix).
- Replaced legacy note/audio components with a single NotesPanel supporting typing, voice-to-text, audio recording, and transcription.
- Resolved a hooks-order runtime error in PhotoGallery.
- Verified builds after each change.

## Changes by Area

### Acreage Tools (routes/acreage.tsx)
- Fixed polygon serialization: save `{x,y}` as `[x,y]` and restore back to `{x,y}`.
- Result: previously broken polygon mapping now persists and reloads correctly.

### Ponds & Mapping (components/PondsMap.tsx)
- Reliability
  - Accordion open: now listens on `document` for `accordion:open` to trigger `invalidateSize` + `fitBounds` reliably.
  - Misc points rendered with `L.circleMarker` to avoid missing default Leaflet icon assets.
- UX improvements
  - Default base layer set to Aerial (Esri imagery).
  - Added a small north arrow control (top-right); styles in `styles.css` under `.north-arrow`.
  - "Use My Location" button: prompts geolocation, drops a marker + small accuracy circle, recenters to zoom 16.
  - Find input: accepts `lat,lon` or address; addresses geocoded via Nominatim; drops green marker and centers.
  - Simplified view at low zoom: at zoom <= 12, hides pond polygons/depths/misc and shows one centroid marker per pond with label; restoring details on zoom-in.
- Visual/stacking
  - Raised header z-index (in `styles.css`) from 10 to 1000 so sticky header/search stays above the map when scrolling.
- Fixes
  - Added missing `goSearch()` function.
  - Restored `armedDeletePondId` state after refactor.

### Notes (Unified Panel)
- Replaced: `NoteForm`, `AudioNotesPanel`, and `VoiceNote` were removed.
- Added: `components/NotesPanel.tsx` provides a single interface that includes:
  - Text notes: input + Add saves to Dexie and logs the action.
  - Voice-to-text dictation: uses Web Speech API (gated, disabled with tooltip on unsupported browsers). Dictate toggles to Stop; appends interim/final results to text.
  - Audio recording: uses MediaRecorder; includes microphone device picker (`enumerateDevices`) and Refresh. Uses selected `deviceId` in `getUserMedia` constraints. Improved error messages for NotFound/NotAllowed.
  - Transcription: uses `transcribeWithOpenAI` (Whisper API). Requires API key in Settings; stores transcript on the audio note for inclusion in PDFs.
- Integration: `routes/job.tsx` now renders `<NotesPanel jobId={jobId} />` in the Notes accordion.

### Photo Gallery (components/PhotoGallery.tsx)
- Fixed hooks-order error by moving `useObjectUrl` inside a child `PhotoThumb` component rather than calling a hook inside `.map()`.

## Files Touched

- Modified
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/routes/acreage.tsx`
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/PondsMap.tsx`
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/styles.css`
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/routes/job.tsx`
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/PhotoGallery.tsx`
- Added
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/NotesPanel.tsx`
- Removed
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/NoteForm.tsx`
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/AudioNotesPanel.tsx`
  - `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/VoiceNote.tsx`

## Build/Validation

- Ran `npm run build` in `apps/vplm-portal` after each change set; all builds succeeded.
- Verified that the mapping panel resizes on accordion open, supports aerial default, geolocation, and search, and simplifies at low zoom.
- Notes panel tested for typing, dictation gating, recording with device selection, and transcription flow (requires API key).
- Fixed hooks order error in PhotoGallery by refactor; no runtime hook order issues remain observed.

## Follow-ups (Optional)

- Add delete actions for audio memos and text notes.
- Inline statuses for dictation/recording (e.g., "Listening", "Recording").
- Debounce geocoding and/or cache results; optionally add a proxy if rate limits are encountered.
- Make the zoom threshold for simplified pond view configurable.
