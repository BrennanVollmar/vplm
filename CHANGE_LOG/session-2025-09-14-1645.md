# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-14 16:45

## What changed
- Added a new guardrail to `AGENTS.md` to define a clear trigger: when the user says "start server", the agent will start the site with `npm run dev` from the repo root and confirm it on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Why
- To reduce ambiguity and ensure consistent behavior when the user requests the development server to be started.

## Files touched
- Modified: `AGENTS.md`

## Validation/Build steps
- No application code changed. Guardrail text updated only.
- Prior context: dev server previously verified via `npm run dev` and `vite preview`. No new server launch performed as part of this guardrail edit.

## Follow-ups
- If "start server" is requested, run `npm run dev` and report status/URL.
