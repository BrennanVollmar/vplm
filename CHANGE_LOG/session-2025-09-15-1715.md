# Session Notes — 2025-09-15 17:15

## What changed
- Cleaned encoding artifacts (mojibake) in `CHANGE_LOG/session-2025-09-12-1547.md` and removed stray `CHANGE_LOG_session_tmp.md` at repo root.
- Scaffolded a minimal MCP server under `mcp/` exposing `list_dir`, `read_file`, and `search_text` tools over stdio.

## Why
- Normalize the change log per guardrails and keep the latest session authoritative and readable.
- Provide a ready MCP entry point so an MCP-capable client (e.g., Claude Desktop) can browse/search the repo contextually.

## Files touched
- Modified: `CHANGE_LOG/session-2025-09-12-1547.md` (rewritten with clean ASCII/UTF-8 characters)
- Removed: `CHANGE_LOG_session_tmp.md`
- Added: `mcp/package.json`, `mcp/index.js`

## Validation/Build steps
- Installed MCP server dependency: `npm --prefix mcp install` (0 vulnerabilities).
- Built the app: `npm run build` (vite build succeeded).

## Follow-ups
- Optional: extend MCP server with write-protected code edits or structured code intel (e.g., symbols index) if needed.
- If you use Claude Desktop, add the server config (see setup notes below in the assistant message).


- Added ChatGPT Actions REST bridge under ctions/ with OpenAPI at /openapi.json and endpoints /list, /read, /search.
- Installed deps and wired root script ctions:start.

- Added HTTP transport for MCP (mcp/index-http.js); script: npm --prefix mcp run http.

## Memory Update — MCP Connector
- User attempted to add MCP via HTTPS in ChatGPT and saw "error creating connector".
- Guidance provided: ChatGPT cannot reach localhost; expose MCP HTTP server via a public HTTPS tunnel (e.g., `npx ngrok http 3333` or `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:3333`) and use that HTTPS URL in ChatGPT’s MCP tool config.
- Verified run commands: `npm --prefix mcp run http` (HTTP), tunnel command (ngrok/Cloudflare), then add the tunnel URL in ChatGPT MCP settings.
- Next steps: If errors persist, add a `/health` endpoint and increase logging to diagnose handshake; optionally add root alias `mcp:http` for convenience.
