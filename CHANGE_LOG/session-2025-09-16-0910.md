# Session Notes — 2025-09-16 09:10

## What changed
- Prepared MCP HTTP server for Render deployment (binds to `0.0.0.0` and uses `PORT`).
- Set `mcp` package to start the HTTP transport by default (`npm start`).
- Removed the ChatGPT Actions REST bridge (`actions/` directory) as it’s not needed for Render.
- Added Node engine constraint for Render runtime.
- Added `render.yaml` to auto-provision a Render Web Service (monorepo rootDir set to `mcp`).

## Why
- Render requires services to listen on `PORT` and all interfaces. The stdio MCP is not suitable for Render; HTTP transport is.
- Simplified repo by removing the Actions bridge in favor of a single Render-hosted MCP endpoint for ChatGPT MCP.

## Files touched
- Modified: `mcp/index-http.js`, `mcp/package.json`, root `package.json`
- Removed: `actions/` (entire directory)
- Added: `render.yaml`

## Validation/Build steps
- Local sanity: `npm --prefix mcp run http` starts server on http://127.0.0.1:3333; logs confirm startup.
- Render will run `npm start` in `mcp` with `PORT` provided.

## Follow-ups
- Create a Render Web Service pointing to `mcp/` directory and use `npm start`.
- After deploy, add the Render HTTPS URL in ChatGPT MCP connectors.
