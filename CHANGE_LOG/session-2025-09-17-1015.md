# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-17 10:15

## What changed
- Added multiple ChatGPT-friendly MCP tools with one-word underscore names in `mcp/index-http.js`:
  - `list_`, `tree_`, `read_`, `head_`, `tail_`, `stat_`, `search_`, `grep_`, `find_`, `hash_`, `info_`.
- Kept original aliases (`list_dir`, `read_file`, `search_text`) for compatibility.

## Why
- Provide a richer, standardized tool surface for the ChatGPT MCP connector using the requested naming convention.

## Files touched
- Modified: `mcp/index-http.js`

## Validation
- Local type/logic review only; Render deployment uses Node 18+.
- HTTP endpoints (`/health`, `/`, `/mcp`) unchanged apart from tools expansion.

## Follow-ups
- If performance becomes an issue, add ripgrep-backed search on Render or introduce path/size filters.
- Add auth if you plan to expose MCP beyond trusted clients.
