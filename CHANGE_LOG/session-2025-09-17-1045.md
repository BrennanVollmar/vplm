# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-17 10:45

## What changed
- Added additional ChatGPT-accessible MCP tools: `glob_`, `json_`, `lines_`, `words_`, `b64_`, `scripts_`.
- Created `mcp/config.toml` with HTTP and stdio server entries for use with other MCP clients.

## Why
- Broaden useful read-only tooling for browsing, searching, and inspecting the repo from ChatGPT MCP.
- Provide a portable config template for other MCP software.

## Files touched
- Modified: `mcp/index-http.js`
- Added: `mcp/config.toml`

## Validation
- Local review and dependency state verified. Render uses Node 18+, Express route and MCP endpoints unchanged.

## Follow-ups
- If you want auth, add a token check for POST `/` and `/mcp` and set an env var on Render.
- Consider ripgrep integration for faster search if needed on Render.
