# Session Notes — 2025-09-17 11:20

## What changed
- Exposed all new one-word underscore tools as ChatGPT Actions via REST endpoints under `/actions/<tool>`.
- Added `mcp/openapi.json` and served it at `GET /openapi.json` for Custom GPT import.

## Why
- User wants these tools callable as Actions from the ChatGPT browser in addition to MCP.

## Files touched
- Modified: `mcp/index-http.js` (added REST action routes and OpenAPI serving)
- Added: `mcp/openapi.json`

## Validation
- Endpoints return JSON or text according to the action; health endpoints unchanged.
- Render service should now expose both MCP and REST Actions on the same domain.

## Follow-ups
- If Actions import fails, confirm `https://vplm.onrender.com/openapi.json` is reachable and valid JSON.
- Optionally add auth token requirement for `/actions/*` routes.

## Memory Update — Quick
- Render URL: https://vplm.onrender.com (health at /health).
- Actions live at POST /actions/<tool>; OpenAPI at /openapi.json (use for Custom GPT import).
- MCP also available at POST /mcp and POST /.
- Added underscore-named tools: list_, tree_, read_, head_, tail_, stat_, search_, grep_, find_, hash_, info_, glob_, json_, lines_, words_, b64_, scripts_.
