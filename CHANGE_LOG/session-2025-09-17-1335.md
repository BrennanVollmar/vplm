# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-17 13:35

## What changed
- Root `npm run dev` now starts both the site and API concurrently via `concurrently`.
- Added `apps/vplm-portal/.env` with `VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3333` for local API calls.

## Why
- Simplify local workflow so a single command brings up both servers.

## Validation
- Background start attempts from the assistant are not persisted in this environment; run `npm run dev` locally in your terminal.

## Follow-ups
- If port 5173 or 3333 is taken, set a different `PORT` and update `VITE_API_URL` accordingly.
