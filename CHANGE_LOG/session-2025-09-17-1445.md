# Session Notes — 2025-09-17 14:45

## What changed
- Added desktop/startup helpers:
  - `scripts/dev.ps1` and `scripts/dev.cmd` to start the Vite site and open the browser.
  - `scripts/add-desktop-shortcut.ps1` to create a Desktop shortcut that runs `dev.cmd`.
  - `scripts/check-site.ps1` to quickly check site status.
- Ensured full app is auth-gated and seeded local developer users.
- Adjusted root `dev` script to only start the Vite site; `dev:api` remains for on-demand API/MCP.

## Why
- Start site automatically at session start and give you a one-click Desktop button to launch it on demand.
- Keep API/MCP optional; site should always be viewable during sessions.

## Files touched
- Added: `scripts/dev.ps1`, `scripts/dev.cmd`, `scripts/add-desktop-shortcut.ps1`, `scripts/check-site.ps1`.
- Modified previously: `apps/vplm-portal/src/app.tsx`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `mcp/data/users.json`.

## Validation
- In this environment, background processes don’t persist; local runs should use `npm run dev` or the new scripts. Site check script added.

## Follow-ups
- Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/add-desktop-shortcut.ps1` once to place the shortcut on your Desktop.
- Double‑click the “VPLM Dev Server” shortcut to start the site anytime.
