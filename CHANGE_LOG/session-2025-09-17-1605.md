# Session Notes — 2025-09-17 16:05

## What Changed (Detailed Memory)
- Global
  - Kept site fully auth‑gated. Developer features are dev‑only and local‑first (no API dependency required for core UX).
  - Fixed a crash (React not defined) by switching ad‑hoc React refs to proper `useRef` imports.
  - Removed Tools from nav; tools live in Job editing.

- Developer Panel (Admin)
  - Moved Environment here (OpenAI + OpenWeather keys, Default Employee name, Clear Cache).
  - Added City/County master lists (comma‑separated). Job form merges suggestions from prior jobs + master lists.
  - Admin user management is local‑first (Name, Email, Phone, Password, Role). Add/Edit/Delete with confirm. No jobs/data are deleted when users are removed.

- Settings (User)
  - Redesigned with Default Employee and switches for Dark Mode + Field Mode. Dark mode button simplified (no "toggle" text).

- Help
  - Rewrote as editable accordion with domain‑specific examples for Job Creation, Mapping, Photos/Camera, Notes/Voice, Water Quality, Export/PDF. Saved in localStorage.

- Jobs
  - Job model now supports City/County/Zip; New Job UI aligned in a responsive grid with datalist selectors for City/County (merged with master lists) and ZIP validation.
  - Time panel shows a live log (Date, Arrival, Departure, Duration in `##hr ##min`).
  - Job Summary is print‑ready and opens clean PDFs (Print → Save as PDF). Offline lists per‑job PDF path.

- Photos & Notes
  - Ponds & Mapping: added "Capture Map Snapshot" saving a PNG into Photos (html2canvas).
  - Photo lightbox: click-to-enlarge, arrow navigation, Delete with confirm.
  - Dictation in Notes appends continuously (final results only previously; now stop’s dictation uses continuous appending too). Placeholders cleaned.
  - Voice memos fixed: duration saved, zero‑length blocked; playback uses `<source type>` for broad compatibility. Delete with confirm.

- All Jobs Map
  - Now displays polygons (shapes) and a Sites Table (Client/Site/Address/City/County/Zip/Location) with Zoom.

- Fish Runs
  - Dexie v14: `fishRuns`, `fishStops` tables added. Audio notes can link to a stop via `stopId`.
  - New Fish Run creation flow for pre‑planning and day‑of updates: Title/Planned Date/Notes, Add Stops, per‑stop dictation (continuous), per‑stop voice memos.
  - Each Stop has location + fish/field data split: Address (geocoding via Nominatim), Lat/Lon inputs, and "Set From Map" (click the Run Map to set).
  - Run Map added: Aerial default with Street toggle, scale control, markers for stops, polyline connecting stops, auto‑fit. Idle map sizing fixed.
  - Run selector to load an existing run for editing; Delete Run with confirm.
  - Fish Run Summary view (print/PDF) with stops and linked memos. Offline page lists Fish Runs for PDF export.

- Two‑step deletes
  - Applied confirm prompts to Photos (lightbox), Text Notes, Voice Memos, Tasks, Users (jobs/data preserved), Ponds and points (existing), Jobs (existing).

## Why
- Provide a secure, local‑first, field‑friendly app that reflects actual workflows: plan runs beforehand, update on site, capture maps/photos/memos, and produce legible PDFs.

## Files Touched (Key)
- Developer/Admin: `apps/vplm-portal/src/routes/admin.tsx`
- Settings: `apps/vplm-portal/src/routes/settings.tsx`
- Help: `apps/vplm-portal/src/app.tsx`
- Job form: `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/JobForm.tsx`, `src/types.ts`
- Time panel: `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/JobTimePanel.tsx`
- Notes/Voice: `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/NotesPanel.tsx`
- Photos/Lightbox: `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/PhotoGallery.tsx`
- Mapping: `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/PondsMap.tsx`, `src/routes/map.tsx`
- Offline/PDF: `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/JobSummary.tsx`, `src/routes/offline.tsx`
- Fish Runs: `apps/vplm-portal/src/features/offline/db.ts` (v14), `src/components/FishRunForm.tsx`, `src/components/FishRunSummary.tsx`, `src/app.tsx`
- Tasks: `apps/vplm-portal/src/components/TaskList.tsx`

## Validation/Build
- Built successfully after changes (`npm run build`). Dictation is continuous for stop notes; voice memos save and replay; Run Map mirrors main map behavior; map snapshot saves to Photos; PDFs print with structure.
- Known benign warnings: large bundle size notifications from Vite.

## How To Use
- Start site: `npm run dev` (Desktop shortcut available). Login is required for all routes.
- Developer tab: manage users, default employee, API keys, master lists, and Clear Cache.
- New Job: aligned grid, City/County/Zip selectors. City/County merge previous values with Developer master lists.
- Time: Clock In/Out and see log with durations.
- Notes: Dictate continuously; add voice memos; delete with confirm.
- Photos: Click to enlarge; navigate; delete with confirm. Use Map Snapshot to save map to Photos.
- All Jobs Map: see polygons and sites table; Zoom to any job.
- Fish Runs: plan run, add stops (address geocode or map click), capture memos per stop, print fish run summary from Offline.

## Follow‑ups (Optional)
- Per‑stop reordering (Up/Down) and highlighting current "Set From Map" stop.
- Add a mini map per stop for location picking (instead of shared Run Map click).
- Central confirm helper to unify all delete confirmations (currently consistent but inline).
- More domain language in Help (SOPs, checklists) if you want me to write them out.
