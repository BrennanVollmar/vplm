# Session Notes - 2025-09-17 19:09

## What Changed
- Fixed the fish run stop editor wiring so map picking is routed through props and highlights when active.
- Imported the offline db for stop memo fetches and updated helper text for the map picker button.

## Why
- Stop blocks previously referenced state that was out of scope and failed to load voice memos, breaking the fish run creation workflow.

## Files Touched
- apps/vplm-portal/src/components/FishRunForm.tsx

## Validation
- npm run build

## Follow-ups
- Consider styling the active stop card while awaiting a map click so the state change is more obvious.

## Additional Updates
- Reordered the stop editor fields so location, mapping, and fish details flow in a practical order with the address lookup embedded in place.
- Moved the map picker controls directly beneath the address to guide setting coordinates before entering fish data.
- npm run build

## Additional Updates
- Shifted the Set From Map control to follow the lat/lon inputs so location entry flows address → coordinates → map placement before fish details.
- npm run build

## Additional Updates
- Patched the run map click handler to use a live ref so "Set From Map" drops coordinates on the intended stop.
- Added microphone permission checks, note focus, and surfaced dictation errors to remove the blocked mic icon and keep speech-to-text reliable.
- Dictate buttons now focus their textarea as soon as recording starts for faster entry.
- npm run build

## Additional Updates
- Forced the Vite dev server to run over https with a consistent localhost origin and tightened scripts/tools to expect the secure URL.
- Updated helper scripts and QA tooling to trust the self-signed cert and open https://localhost:5173 by default.
- npm run build

## Additional Updates
- Added @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl so the dev server issues a proper TLS certificate and Chrome no longer reports cipher mismatches.
- npm run build

## Additional Updates
- Collapsed each fish run stop into its own accordion with summary stats so the list stays compact while keeping map pickers in view.
- Automatically keeps the latest stop expanded and syncs accordion state with map selection.
- npm run build

## Memory Update
- Fish run stops now render inside individual accordions that auto-focus the active stop, keeping the editor compact.
- Dev server scripts default to https://localhost:5173 with a self-signed cert via @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl.
- Dictation flow requests mic access, focuses the note textarea, and reports errors for clarity.
