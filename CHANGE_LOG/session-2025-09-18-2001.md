# Session Notes - 2025-09-18 20:01

## What Changed
- Removed the deprecated --https flag from the Vite dev and preview scripts so the secure dev server can launch.

## Why
- Vite 7 rejects the --https CLI option, which caused npm run dev to exit immediately.

## Files Touched
- apps/vplm-portal/package.json

## Validation
- npm run dev

## Follow-ups
- None.

## Additional Updates
- Replaced the old @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl setup with vite-plugin-mkcert so the dev server issues a certificate chain Windows trusts after installing the mkcert CA.
- Ran mkcert's installer to register the local root certificate in the Windows trust store.
- npm install --prefix apps/vplm-portal
- npm run dev
## Additional Updates
- Rebuilt the dictation and voice memo flows with shared hooks (`useAudioRecorder`, `useDictation`) and inline status messaging across NotesPanel and FishStopEditor.
- Voice memo lists refresh after new recordings and newly opened stop accordions smooth-scroll into view so the active editor stays centered.
- npm run build
## Memory Update
- Dev HTTPS uses vite-plugin-mkcert with the local CA installed so Chrome trusts https://localhost:5173.
- Notes and stop editors now share fresh dictation/voice memo hooks that surface permission issues and save recordings reliably.
- Opening a stop accordion scrolls it into view, keeping the active editor centered on long run forms.
