# Session Notes - 2025-09-22 11:36

## What Changed
- Added a Dexie `addressBank` store plus helpers so address entries sync between developer tools and the map.
- Rebuilt the Map tab to show an address bank accordion with search and purple pins sourced from the shared bank.
- Replaced the Developer admin UI with clearer user management and a full address bank manager (lookup, edit, delete).
- Removed legacy master city/county settings and cleaned the job form to derive suggestions from existing jobs only.

## Why
- Developers needed a structured address bank with contacts and coordinates that feeds both admin and field users.

## Files Touched
- apps/vplm-portal/src/features/offline/db.ts
- apps/vplm-portal/src/routes/map.tsx
- apps/vplm-portal/src/routes/admin.tsx
- apps/vplm-portal/src/components/JobForm.tsx

## Validation
- npm run build

## Follow-ups
- Consider exposing address bank entries inside Job creation for quick prefills if crews request it.
### Update - Client Bank polish (later same session)
- Renamed the Address Bank to Client Bank end-to-end and refreshed the Map tab wording to match.
- Reworked the developer Client Bank form with contact add/edit/delete controls instead of textarea parsing, storing structured contacts plus notes.
- Surfaced labeled contact lists for crews on the Map accordion, with purple pins still syncing to saved coordinates.
- npm run build
### Update - Address Autocomplete rollout
- Added Mapbox-backed address autocomplete with OSM fallback via a reusable component and helper service.
- Wired the new picker into job creation/editing, fish run stops, client bank management, and the Map tab search.
- Extended client bank entries with structured contacts, automatic coordinate capture, and richer map display.
- Refreshed Developer settings with Mapbox key storage plus an API setup guide covering Mapbox, OpenWeather, and OpenAI.
- npm run build
### Memory Update
- Address autocomplete relies on Mapbox token stored in browser localStorage (`mapbox_access_token`) with automatic OSM fallback if blank.
- OpenWeather (`openweather_key`) and OpenAI Whisper (`openai_api_key`) keys remain local-only; Developer settings card explains setup and alternatives.
- Client Bank entries now hold structured contacts plus coordinates; Map tab and job/fish run forms auto-fill lat/lon when a suggestion is selected.
