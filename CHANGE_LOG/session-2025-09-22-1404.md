# Session Notes - 2025-09-22 14:04

## What Changed
- Persist audio notes as array buffers and added a blob rehydration helper so saved memos reopen with real audio instead of zero-byte blobs.
- Normalised audio recorder MIME priorities for Safari/iOS compatibility and updated every consumer to derive playback/transcription blobs through the new helper with graceful fallbacks.
- Tightened transcription calls with empty-clip guards plus detailed OpenAI error surfacing.
- Surfaced live dictation previews in job notes and fish stop editors so interim speech appears while speaking.

## Why
- Memos recorded on mobile Safari were saved as empty blobs, leaving 0s clips that would not play or transcribe.
- Crew members needed visual feedback that dictation is actively capturing speech instead of waiting for the final phrase.

## Files Touched
- apps/vplm-portal/src/features/offline/db.ts
- apps/vplm-portal/src/lib/audio.ts
- apps/vplm-portal/src/lib/transcribe.ts
- apps/vplm-portal/src/components/NotesPanel.tsx
- apps/vplm-portal/src/components/FishRunForm.tsx
- apps/vplm-portal/src/components/FishRunSummary.tsx

## Validation
- npm run build

## Follow-ups
- Consider a background migration to reinterpret previously saved zero-byte audio notes so crews know they must be re-recorded.

### Update - Recorder settle + language normalisation
- Wait for MediaRecorder data chunks (with a short timeout) before finalising clips so iOS/Safari memos no longer save as 0-byte blobs, and trigger `requestData()` prior to stopping to flush buffered audio.
- Normalised language codes to ISO-639-1 for stored memos and transcription requests, preventing OpenAI HTTP 400 errors for `en-US` tags and similar locales.
- npm run build
### Update - Dictation UX + time clock fixes
- Rebuilt dictation handling to stream interim words straight into note fields (matching iPhone voice typing) while keeping committed text clean.
- Hardened audio persistence by storing both raw byte arrays and original blobs so Safari memos stop saving as 0-byte files, and forced MediaRecorder timeslicing/requestData to flush audio reliably.
- Overhauled time tracking so each clock-in creates its own entry, clock-out closes the latest open shift, and totals display aggregated hours for the job and admin view.
- npm run build
### Update - Voice memo transcripts ➜ notes
- Added a “Save Transcript as Note” action after transcription so crews can drop voice memo text straight into the note list with a voice-memo label and avoid retyping.
- Marked promoted memos to prevent duplicate note creation and refreshed both note and memo lists on save.
- npm run build
### Update - Dictation polish + memo reliability
- Reworked live dictation to stream words continuously, auto-capitalize sentences, and add trailing punctuation so it reads like the Whisper transcript once phrases finalize.
- Simplified memo storage to persist raw byte arrays only and reworked recorder shutdown to wait for the last MediaRecorder chunk, eliminating new zero-second clips.
- npm run build
### Update - Note editing & dev UX polish
- Removed dictation buttons from notes and fish stops, keeping manual entry plus voice memos; job notes now support inline editing with cancel/save controls.
- Centered every accordion expansion (shared Accordion + fish run details) so opened content scrolls into view automatically.
- Reworked the developer page layout with responsive grids, consistent spacing, and scrollable tables to fix misaligned cards and forms.
- Cached address autocomplete queries with a 3+ character threshold and 350ms debounce to cut down on Mapbox/OSM calls while keeping suggestions responsive.
- npm run build
### Memory Update
- Notes panel now supports inline editing with Save/Cancel, voice memos remain the audio capture path (dictation UI removed).
- Fish run stop notes are manual entry only; crews rely on voice memos for spoken notes.
- Accordions center themselves when opened for better visibility in map, fish run, and admin screens.
- Developer admin page uses responsive grid layouts; address autocomplete caches results (3+ characters, 350ms debounce) to limit Mapbox/OSM calls.
### Update - MCP removal
- Removed the legacy `mcp/` server directory, related root scripts, Render config, and setup docs now that the project no longer uses MCP tooling.
- Cleaned `.gitignore` and root package scripts so only the Vite site tooling remains.
### Update - Admin page cleanup
- Simplified developer user management to use local cached accounts only and removed the stale API connection warning banner (MCP server no longer required).
- `npm run build`
### Update - GitHub Pages deploy script
- Simplified the site deploy command to `gh-pages -d dist -b gh-pages` (removed the unused `-t true` flag).
- npm run build
### Update - UI alignment polish
- Tightened note list layout so edit/save buttons sit directly under each note instead of stretching across the row.
- Added a minimum width to the job time table to keep totals aligned with their columns.
- npm run build
### Update - Persistent auth & automatic backups
- Login now persists across refreshes by storing the signed-in developer account locally; the inactive API check no longer signs users out on reload.
- Introduced automatic local backups for every data change (jobs, notes, runs, etc.) with a developer UI to download or clear snapshot history.
- Added manual "Backup Now" control under Developer settings so teams can export JSON snapshots off-device.
- npm run build
### Update - SPA 404 fallback
- Postbuild now copies `dist/index.html` to `dist/404.html` so GitHub Pages refreshes/deep links load the app instead of returning a 404.
- npm run build
