## What Changed
- Updated the service worker navigation handler to serve the cached SPA shell when static hosting responds with a 404 so deep-link reloads stay in-app.
- Bumped the static cache version to trigger client updates to the new navigation fallback logic.

## Why
- Reloading or hard-navigating to nested routes on hosting that lacks history rewrites (e.g., GitHub Pages) returned a 404 page instead of booting the React app.

## Files Touched
- apps/vplm-portal/public/sw.js

## Validation
- npm run build

## Follow-ups
- After deploying, verify a deep link reload (e.g., /jobs/123) now boots from the service worker without surfacing the GitHub 404 page.

### Update - Deployment
- Published the refreshed build to GitHub Pages via `npm --prefix apps/vplm-portal run deploy`.
- Confirmed https://lakemanagementservice.com/sw.js?nocache=<timestamp> now serves the v3 navigation fallback service worker.

### Update - Immediate Service Worker Activation
- Added `self.skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` so new SW releases take control right away, ensuring navigation fallbacks apply on the very next reload.
- Redeployed the build and confirmed the live `sw.js` now includes the immediate activation logic.

### Update - GitHub Pages 404 fallback
- Added `scripts/postbuild.mjs` to copy the built `index.html` to `dist/404.html` and write the `CNAME`, ensuring GitHub Pages serves the SPA shell for any unknown path.
- Switched the custom domain to `lakemanagementservice.com` so the apex domain uses the same fallback assets as `www`.
- Rebuilt, redeployed, and confirmed `/login` and other deep links return the React app markup even though the server responds 404.

### Update - CNAME revert
- Restored the custom domain configuration to `www.lakemanagementservice.com` after confirming GitHub Pages expects the original host mapping.
- Rebuilt and redeployed with the updated postbuild script so future builds continue copying the SPA shell to `404.html` and writing the correct CNAME.

### Note - Deployment discipline
- Reminder captured to commit and push after each change set so hosted site stays in sync with repository updates.

### Update - Trusted device login persistence
- Reworked the auth provider to hydrate from trusted-device sessions before routing, preventing route guards from bouncing refreshed tabs back to `/login`.
- Added a 24-hour "trust this device" option on the login form; successful logins record a timestamped device entry so refreshes and quick returns skip the credential prompt.
- Updated guarded routes to wait for auth hydration and redirect users back to their intended path after signing in.
- npm run build
