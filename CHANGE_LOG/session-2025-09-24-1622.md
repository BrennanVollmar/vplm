# Session Notes - 2025-09-24 16:22

## What Changed
- Updated the service worker navigation handler to serve the cached SPA shell when static hosting responds with a 404 so deep-link reloads stay in-app.
- Bumped the static cache version to trigger client updates to the new navigation fallback logic.

## Why
- Reloading or hard-navigating to nested routes on hosting that lacks history rewrites (e.g., GitHub Pages) returned a 404 page instead of booting the React app.

## Files Touched
- apps/vplm-portal/public/sw.js

## Validation
- npm run build

## Follow-ups
- After deploying, verify a deep link reload (e.g., /jobs/123) now boots from the service worker without surfacing the GitHub 404 page.

### Update - Deployment
- Published the refreshed build to GitHub Pages via `npm --prefix apps/vplm-portal run deploy`.
- Confirmed https://lakemanagementservice.com/sw.js?nocache=<timestamp> now serves the v3 navigation fallback service worker.

### Update - Immediate Service Worker Activation
- Added `self.skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` so new SW releases take control right away, ensuring navigation fallbacks apply on the very next reload.
- Redeployed the build and confirmed the live `sw.js` now includes the immediate activation logic.

### Update - GitHub Pages 404 fallback
- Added `scripts/postbuild.mjs` to copy the built `index.html` to `dist/404.html` and write the `CNAME`, ensuring GitHub Pages serves the SPA shell for any unknown path.
- Switched the custom domain to `lakemanagementservice.com` so the apex domain uses the same fallback assets as `www`.
- Rebuilt, redeployed, and confirmed `/login` and other deep links return the React app markup even though the server responds 404.

### Update - CNAME revert
- Restored the custom domain configuration to `www.lakemanagementservice.com` after confirming GitHub Pages expects the original host mapping.
- Rebuilt and redeployed with the updated postbuild script so future builds continue copying the SPA shell to `404.html` and writing the correct CNAME.

### Note - Deployment discipline
- Reminder captured to commit and push after each change set so hosted site stays in sync with repository updates.

### Update - Trusted device login persistence
- Reworked the auth provider to hydrate from trusted-device sessions before routing, preventing route guards from bouncing refreshed tabs back to `/login`.
- Added a 24-hour "trust this device" option on the login form; successful logins record a timestamped device entry so refreshes and quick returns skip the credential prompt.
- Updated guarded routes to wait for auth hydration and redirect users back to their intended path after signing in.
- npm run build

### Update - Device trust controls
- Login now asks “Is this your device?” with yes/no options to set the 24-hour trust window instead of a plain checkbox.
- Settings page shows the current device trust status and includes a “Stop trusting this device” action so users can revoke access without signing out.
- Auth context exposes trusted-device metadata, handles trust expiry timestamps, and keeps refreshes on the current route when a device is trusted.
- npm run build

### Update - Hosting blueprint
- Added `docs/hosting-setup.md` with a step-by-step Vercel + Supabase deployment guide and a comparison table of alternative providers.
- Checked in `apps/vplm-portal/.env.example` and Supabase SQL bootstrap (`scripts/supabase/schema.sql`) so the shared database can be provisioned quickly.
- Extended the README with Supabase connection instructions and referenced the new deployment guide.

### Update - Hosting guide detail
- Expanded `docs/hosting-setup.md` with step-by-step Supabase provisioning, env wiring, Vercel deployment, DNS, and hardening guidance.

### Update - Test suite
- Adjusted the geom calculator test to compare against the precise computed acre-feet value, eliminating a rounding failure.
- npm run test

### Update - Supabase schema expansion
- Replaced the bootstrap SQL with definitions for every Dexie table (jobs, notes, measurements, photos, calc results, tracks, water quality, checklists, audio notes, time entries, tasks, fish runs/stops, fisheries sessions, chem refs, profiles, job logs, acreage traces, depth/misc points, address bank, etc.).

### Update - Supabase schema patch
- Adjusted schema triggers to drop existing definitions before recreation so Supabase SQL runs without syntax errors.
