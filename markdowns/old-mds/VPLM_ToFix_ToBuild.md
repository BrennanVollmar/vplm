# VPLM Portal Development Tasks

## To Fix

- **Fisheries Study & Job ID Integration**  
  - Fishery studies should be tied directly to a **job ID number**.  
  - Data collected should be stored in that job’s folder.  
  - Users should be able to **create custom species types** and then start counting them (not just limited to a preset list of fish).  

- **Job Time Tracking**  
  - The **clock in / clock out system** should be tied to the **job interface**, so time is tracked specifically within that job’s record.  

- **ChemRef Page Enhancements**  
  - Allow **manual entry** of EPA registration numbers.  
  - Allow **file upload** for attaching EPA label images.  

- **Insurance Number & Profiles**  
  - Insurance license number should be tied directly to **profile creation**.  

## To Build

- **Map / Acreage Tracing & Depths**  
  - Ability to **trace a pond with Google Earth** to get automatic acreage calculations.  
  - Users can place **pins where depth measurements** are taken.  
  - Pins should tie into **average depth calculations**.  

- **Map / Acreage Page by Job ID**  
  - The map/acreage system should have its **own page**.  
  - Navigation should be based on **job ID**.  

- **Persistent Date/Time Widget**  
  - Add a **date/time widget** for applicable pages where tracking date/time matters to the user.
